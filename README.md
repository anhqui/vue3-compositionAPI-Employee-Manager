# employeemanager

In this project, I skillfully crafted an application leveraging the power of Vue 3 and its Composition API, complemented by the sleek styling capabilities of Materialize. The application seamlessly integrates with Firebase, providing a robust foundation for seamless data management. Within this intuitive interface, users can effortlessly navigate through a range of functionalities, including viewing, adding, updating, and deleting employee records.
